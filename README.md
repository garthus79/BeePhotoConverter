# BeePhotoConverter

A simple photo converter that converts HEIC / HEIF files to JPG. This was created because all of the online converters stripped the metadata from the file (date taken, author, etc). This should keep that data in the converted JPG file. 

It uses the following Nuget packages / libraries:\
Magick .NET Core\
Magick .NET.SystemDrawing\
Magick .NET-Q16-x64\
